# Baby Matching Bot
### Developer: Edward Gurney

### You can view the live project here: [Baby Name Matcher](https://baby-matching-bot.herokuapp.com/)
<br>

## **Table of Contents**

This application helps people find names for their new baby. Each user takes it in turn to respond yes 'y' or no 'n' to 20 randomly generated names as they are presented on screen. There are 100's of names that could be generated. 

The users have the choice of selecting boys names, girls names, or (if they don't know the gender) they can select to be presented with both boy and girl names. 

User 1 goes first and responds to the names, user 2 goes second and responds to the same list of randomly generated names that user 1 received. 

At the end of the session, the users are told which names they chose match. If there were no matches then they are told there were no matches.

## **User Experience**

### *Project Goals*

- The Baby Name Matcher helps expecting couples find names that they like in a slightly different and fun way.

### *Site Owner Goals*<br>

- The goal of the app is to help couples choose a name for their baby.
- For users to return and play the games many times until they have decided on a name.
- For the users to enjoy it enough to recommend it to friends and family and share the app. 
- To provide a fun way to pick a baby name for any gender. 
- Produce an app that is scaleable, with opportunities to develop and improve through version releases, that could become a commercialised app with baby brands targetting expectant parents who will be the users.
- I want the user to be forced to enter correct inputs before they can proceed at any point. 

### *First Time User Goals*<br>

- I want to be able to start a game quickly, straight into selecting the gender and then receving the names for me to vote on. 
- I want it to be easy to understand.
- I want to be able to select boy names, girl names or both names (in case I don't know the gender)
- I want it to be easy to play, as little typing as possible.
- I want to be able to play again after each game.
- I want to be able to enter my name and my partners name.
- I want to be able to see the matches that I have with my partner

### *Returning User Goals*

- I want the app to be quick to start going through the names so that I can have quick sessions when I have 5 minutes spare.
- I want to be able to see the matches I have with my partner. 
- I want to have lot's of different names so that I don't get the same names all the time. 

### *Repeat User Goals*

- I want to be able to see my matches with my partner
- I want to have lot's of different names so that I don't keep seeing the same names.

## **Design**

### *Flowchart*


<details>
  <summary>Here is the flow chart that was designed at the concept stage of the app. </summary>

## **Technology Used**

### *Languages*
- Python 3

### *Frameworks and Programmes*
- Github
- Gitpod
- Heroku

### *Libraries*
- Random() - The random module from Python's built in library
was used. This allowed the randome names to be generated from the list of names that the user selected. 

## **Features**

### **Existing Features**

- Below are descriptions of features with screenshots that demonstrate the project outcomes, click on the drop down arrow to view image examples.

#### **Welcome Message**
<details>
  <summary>There is a welcome message at the start of the app with a polite welcome message from the bot.</summary>

</details>
<br>

#### **Confirm Play**

<details>
  <summary>The app will ask if the user wants to play.</summary>

</details>
<br>

#### **Name Entry**

<details>
  <summary>Users can enter their names so that the game is personalised to them, enhancing user experience.</summary>

</details>
<br>

#### **Gender Selection**

<details>
  <summary>Offers the user the choice of genders for their names, boy, girls or both. </summary>
  
  
<img src="views/images/gender_selection.png">

</details>
<br>

#### **Random Names**
- There are hundreds of names stored in the app so that users can play many times and have a decreased chance of seeing the same names.
- The names are never repeated to the same user in the same session.
- User 2 will receive the exact same names that were randomly generated for user 1, to increase the chances of matches.

#### **List of Matched Names**

<details>
  <summary>The users are given a list of the matched names once user 2 has completed their selection. </summary>
  
  
<img src="views/images/matched_names.png">

</details>
<br>

#### **Friendly Bot**
- The app/bot talks to the users in a friendly manner, rather than just asking for inputs and presenting answers. 
- The bot will keep them informed of the rules at the start and assist them if they input a wrong response. 
<details>
  <summary>This screen shot for example shows the bot advising user 1 that their names are coming</summary>

<br>

### **Screenshots**
- All screenshots are in the above section, click on the drop down arrows to access them.  

### **Features to Implement in future Versions**
- Saving the matched list and having the ability to share it to send to others would be a nice addition. 

- During the process of coding, user 1 and user 2 were presented with their own lists once they had made their selections. this was removed from the final version so that users were just presented with their matches. However, this could be re-introduced pending user feedback.

## **Testing**

## **Languages Used & Validation** - Python.
### **PEP8 Validation**
PEP8 online vailidation was used to check for any errors. All of the code passes with no errors or warning present. All code was returned as 'All Right'. Example screen shots of some of the code are below:

## **Bugs**

### Fixed Bugs
- The matches were appearing in list form with the original brackets and quote marks. For example ["Arlo", "James", "Mia"]. This didn't contribute much to user experience. The fix for this was found online (this has been accredited in the credits section), a workround to take these brackets away. After this it still didn't look pleasing to the eye, so I added a new line so the names appeared on their own line.

- The built in functions found online that would be able to find matches, for example using sets (set(a) & set(b)) wasn't having the desired result and was introducing bugs to the program. So I designed my own function, with a for loop and using the len() method to get the desired result. 


<br>

### Unfixed Bugs

- After significant testing there does not seem to be any bugs at present.

## **Credits**

- The code used to remove the square brackets and quote marks from the matched named list that is printed to the user at the end of the game was taken from a website called [codegrepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/typescript/how+to+print+list+without+brackets+python)

- Assistance for generating random strings from [kishstats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt3k8pc8f0A&t=549s) on youtube. 

- The flow diagram for the concept stage of the project was done using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)
